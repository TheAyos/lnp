### Week 1:
- Setup explanatory steps in README for efficient git collaboration
- Setup separate development branches to avoid conflicts and to protect main branch
- Setup intial files (gitignore, CMakeLists...)
### Week 2:
- Fixed a bunch of merge conflicts
- Finished file IO (arg parsing, history file parsing, and move output to correct file)
### Week 3:
- Improved performance of the AI by using alpha-beta pruning instead of minimax
- Suggested using a C++ profiler to target optimization efforts (gprof, std::vector functions use 15% of cpu time, switching to bitboard representation will improve performance)
