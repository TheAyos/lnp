# Next steps : 
1. MAKEFILE to do
2. USE the library 'fstream' to parse the input file and generate an output file

- How to open a file for reading : 
std::ifstream inputFile("input.txt");

- How to open a file for writing : 
std::ofstream outputFile("output.txt");

- Read a line from the file :
std::getline(inputFile, line)
--> while (std::getline(inputFile, line))
it reads each line from the file and stores it in the line string, it continues until the end of the file is reached

3. Modelize the board and pieces

4. Modelize basic moves

5. CHECK detection
