### Week 1:
- Create fundamental structures such as Game, Pieces, King
- Start with a king only board, test a possible implementation

### Week 2:
- Completed basic moves except castling, en passant, and promotion
- Made an all legal moves function that can output all normal legal moves in a position
- Successfully made the bot play random moves

### Week 3:
- Finished implementing en passant, castling, and promotion
- Check the correctness of the legal moves checkers using perft and search function
- Begin a first implementation of a minimax algorithm

## Week 4:
- Studied the bitboard
- Bug checks

## Week 5:
- Piece tracking with array
- Bitboard move list optimizations

## Week 6:
- Implemented improved Evaluation with the following:
 * game phase determination
 * improved piece square tables
 * tapered evaluation

## Week 7:
- Implemented zobrist hashing with transposition tables
- Improve and implement better move ordering, including killer moves
- Redesigned search functions
