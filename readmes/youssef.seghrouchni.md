### Week 1:
 - initial setup.
 - spent a loot of time learning git, especially how to manage branches, fix merge conflicts,etc...

### Week 2:
 - implemented the bishop, rook, and queen classes, focusing on modular constructors that integrate well with game logic and project structure
 - started thinking about how special moves like castling could be handled.

### Week 3:
 - with the help of the professor  i fixed a compiler issue on my Apple ARM chip by standardizing the build environment across my team`.
 - started looking into move generation logic and how to handle legal moves efficiently, then explored the basics of minimax (just on paper for now)

### Week 4:
 - Worked on optimizing the evaluation function by adding positional value tables for different pieces to make the evaluation more accurat
 - also spent time understanding how the evaluation connects with move generation and preparing for the bitboard transition

### Week 5:
- spent a lot of time trying to understand this big transition to bitboard since it completely changed the logic. it was also christmas break, so i didnâ€™t contribute much this week.

### Week 6:
 - adapted all the evaluation functions to the new bitboard system and debugged some interactions with move generation
 -   made few cchanges to improve performance and align the logic with the new implementation

### Week 7:
 - mostly tested stuff by running various board setups and checking moves using referees to see if everything was consistent.
